Frontend single page application built in React
The core purpose of this application is for the purposes of displaying my competence in basic React concepts and component based frontend code.

- From a user perspective this app allows a user to create and populate a yarn shop with items, and add items to a cart. 
- Users start at a store picker page which generates random store names based on randomized combinations of adjectives and nouns. 
- Once a store is entered, if this store has not already been established in firebase, there will be the option for the user to sign in with GitHub, Google, or Facebook. 
- This will establish ownership of this store, and allow this user to return to the store page to manage inventory. 
- A fresh store will contain no inventory, so an owner can choose to create items or load in sample items to populate the store.
